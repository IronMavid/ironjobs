## How to run

Easy! First, clone the repo locally. Then install the dependencies with `npm install`.
Last thing: run it on the command line with `npm start`

## How to develop

### Client

The client is all written... but if you want to tweak it, just edit the files
in the `client/` directory. Note that you will need to run `sass` on the styles
in order to build the `style.css` file!
